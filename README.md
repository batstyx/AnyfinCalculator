# AnyfinCalculator
A calculator for Anyfin Can Happen, inbuilt to Hearthstone Deck Tracker.

# So what exactly does this do?
Not much, yet. I'm still writing it. The idea is though, that using Hearthstone Deck Tracker's abilities, whenever the card "Anyfin Can Happen" is hovered over in the player's hand, it will display a quick overview of how much damage it will/could inflict onto the opponent (just counting murloc damage). This would include murlocs on the board, but not other minions.

#Sweet, that sounds awesome. How can I use this?
Well right now you'd have to build it from source, but soon I'm going to have releases. Thes idea is simple enough though - wherever you have Hearthstone Deck Tracker installed, drop the `.dll` created into the 'Plugins' folder. Then run Hearthstone Deck Tracker and enable this plugin in the plugins menu, and ta-da!
