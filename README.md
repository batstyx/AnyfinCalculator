# AnyfinCalculator
A calculator for Anyfin Can Happen, inbuilt to [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/). ***NOTE:*** This currently only works with Hearthstone Deck Tracker commit [ed3aa02](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/commit/ed3aa025a59faee1f46e3f9e6bc14a3229e09363) and later, due to a new API method being used in it, so currently to use it you'll have to compile it by hand.

# So what exactly does this do?
Not much, yet. I'm still writing it. The idea is though, that using Hearthstone Deck Tracker's abilities, whenever the card "Anyfin Can Happen" is hovered over in the player's hand, it will display a quick overview of how much damage it will/could inflict onto the opponent (just counting murloc damage). This would include murlocs on the board, but not other minions.

#Sweet, that sounds awesome. How can I use this?
Well right now you'd have to build it from source, but soon I'm going to have releases. Thes idea is simple enough though - wherever you have Hearthstone Deck Tracker installed, drop the `.dll` created into the 'Plugins' folder. Then run Hearthstone Deck Tracker and enable this plugin in the plugins menu, and ta-da!

#Dude, is this really fair?
To be honest, I don't know anymore. I used to think this was pretty fair, I mean it was something you could do with pen and paper right? But the maths (especially when you get to 7+ minions on board) is really quite complicated. So use it at your own discretion, is my advice.
